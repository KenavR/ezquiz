# [WIP] EzQuiz

This project is just a small example project to illustrate how I would structure an Angular application and handle Observables. The example is still in development and requires Firebase to run.

## Known Issues

- [ ] FB Setting issue with current version -> update
- [ ] Collection check for data import not working every time, results in multiple imports
- [ ] No interactions with Quizzes
- [ ] Some refactoring is necessary, especially when it comes to CSS

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
